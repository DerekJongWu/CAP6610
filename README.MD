# CAP6610 Machine Learning 
#### Author: Derek Wu

Machine Learning is a course that develops computer programs that learn and improve with experiences. Various algorithms were studied with the emphasis on methods based on probability, statitics, and optimization. 

## HW2
Utilized the sklearn two-class Fisher Linear Discriminant Algorithn (FLDA) on the Iris dataset. 

## HW3
Implemented a majorized version of the Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results were compared to the SVM package in sklearn. 

## HW5
Implemented backpropogation for XOR neural network using only one hidden layer. 

## HW6
Implemented a majorization approach to minimizing the Dictionary Learning objective function. 

## HW7
Used Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) and Laplacian Eigenmaps on the Swiss Roll dataset. 

## Project
The project was an open ended problem that involved classifying songs as either Progressive Rock genre or Other. Our group decided to use Long Short Term Memory Units (LSTM) followed by a Dense layer to try and classify parts of the song, and then an ensemble approach was used to finalize the classification process.
